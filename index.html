        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Nicholas Cho. Currently I am a Freshman at UCR working towards a bachelor’s in Economics and Business Administration. My current professional experience consists of various leadership internships as well as working some jobs. Although my major is economics my various jobs consist of very social interactive jobs. The two jobs that I worked were working at a summer camp as a counselor and working as a tutor. 
	My first job was a camp counselor at Camp Bob Waldorf. The job consisted of taking care of kids of the ages from 10 to 15. The summer camp was one of various activities such as sports and arts. When outlining the kind of experience that I had at this camp I would mainly have to say that it consisted of having fun with the kids while also taking care of them. One detail of the camp was that it was a week long camp where the counselors would stay with the camp for about a week. This camp was also a stay the night camp. 
	My other job was working as a tutor at Crescenta Valley Music Academy. As a tutor I would take care of kids from the grades of 4th to 6th grade. My job mainly consisted of correcting the kids homework as well as assigning worksheets and teaching them some basic concepts in every subject. Although I only worked this job for 4 months it was a very good experience in learning to teach as well as balancing time commitments. As I was still a high school senior at that point I learned early on how to manage my time as well as working hard and working efficiently.
	Why I decided to undertake jobs that did not really relate to my major. To be honest, the jobs I was looking for mainly consisted of me looking for experience in jobs and not really what kind of jobs. As I was still unsure of what I really wanted to become I tried out many different experiences to find out what I really wanted to do. Thus by trying out different jobs and opportunities I hope to take these various experiences to mesh them together to create a better me and overall a better person. In this hope of improvement I hope to gain more and more in future opportunities. I hope that by learning more and more I can become more accustomed and more efficient.
	Overall when considering the various opportunities I have taken I believe that through experience I have become a more organized person as well as determined and hardworking. That through these various experiences I have learned the ability to lead and well as teach. The impact of this skill I believe was very important in developing my character as well as giving me a taste of what the real world looks like. Thus the experiences I have gained have helped me become more prepared for jobs that I am to undertake in the future.
